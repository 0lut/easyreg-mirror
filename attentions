In current mermaid version, the network used is unet , with none normalization, t the last layer is group normalized,the weighted linear softmax is used.
we found the small omt or range_loss is useful at the begining of the train
we may not consider the loss of the regularization term at the beginning of the train,
when a ldddmm network is well initialized, then fixed the momentum generation network to fine tune the  smoother network with very small regularization
then, train momentum network and smoother network together with small regularization

3.2 update
the current setting is simpleunet, with last layer group normalzation,
we use use softmax, disable compute weights from preweights, since the map is smooth
the omt loss is set as 0.01.
if you want to change the setttings of the smoothers, make sure there are two smoother setttings to be changed, one in deep smoother
one in forward method


3.3 update
maybe momentum is the better choice for the network input


3.9
need to double check the spacing amplified in resampling image

3.17
any version before cur_settings_adpt_lddmm_new use the 'standardize_divide_input_images', with value 0.5
while current we use is 2

3.21
to do: remove the neumam boundary condition in forward method, so see if it can accelerate the algrithom : no
to do: using spacing transform trick to see if can accerate the forward

3.22 currently all the boundary settings are follow the old one, we will turn into new one one the acceraltion finished
3.23 the current mermaid_net is import from the mermaid_net_multi_channel

speed test, the boundary condition influence the speed, currently we use zero_boundary for the epdiff while use neumann for advect
for the map based weight advect method, there is no parameter added in odeint adjoint method, currently, it seems reasonable

3.24  remove the similarity batch, channel loop for lncc ( only batch based) and ncc (batch channel separate)

3.27  we put the deep loss into separate file and disable ||w||2 for network parameters in smoother factory
3.29  range initial penalty to 6
3.30  clamp is remove in forward model !!!
4.6  clamp is added in forward model,  the softmax is remove in registration network use abs instead
    use_mermaid_iter now is false
    save jacobi image is turn on
4.12  when given the code to nc, remember to comment the things in the dataloader
todo use the softmax in real tasks?

4.19 use interoplation boundary in forward_models_multi_channels
epoch size, epoch num,numofworkds need to be reset
